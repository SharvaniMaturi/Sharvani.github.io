                      <p style="color:white;">Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.  Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood<br />

One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other.<br />

"That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.<br />

When the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye.<br />

"Remember, go straight to Grandma's house," her mother cautioned.  "Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to strangers!  The woods are dangerous."</p>

					  <p style="color:white;">It is a beautiful summer day. The sun shines warmly on an old house near a river. Behind the house a mother duck is sitting on ten eggs. "Tchick." One by one all the eggs break open.<br />

All except one. This one is the biggest egg of all.<br />

Mother duck sits and sits on the big egg. At last it breaks open, "Tchick, tchick!"<br />

Out jumps the last baby duck. It looks big and strong. It is grey and ugly.<br />

The next day mother duck takes all her little ducks to the river. She jumps into it. All her baby ducks jump in. The big ugly duckling jumps in too.
